- **[NgRx](https://ngrx.io/):** A state management library for Angular, based on Redux principles, providing a clear way to manage application state.

## 💡 Project Idea  

The goal of this project is to master a **TypeScript-based stack** for web development. The Frontend is built using **Angular**, while the backend (check out its own [repository](https://github.com/DSaatz/fitness-be)) leverages **Nest.js** for an amazing user experience.

By combining **fitness** and **coding**, this project is a reflection of my two passions, offering an app that’s both fun to build and practical to use. 💻❤️💪
